                    <p>I’m a New Jersey native (with no accent remaining) that graduated from New York University. It
                        was there, on September 11th, 2001, that I found myself at the bottom of the collapsing Twin
                        Towers in NYC asking God to save my life. That’s obviously a longer story, which I tell here.
                        Most importantly, I am a disciple of Jesus, husband to Shannon, and father to Abigail, Gideon &
                        Titus. Least importantly, I enjoy playing basketball, watching USA curling, eating hot wings and
                        smoking meat on my Traeger. <br>
                        <br> In 2012 my family and I moved to California so I could serve as the director of Calvary
                        Chapel Bible College. My love for the Scriptures overflowed into a book I wrote titled, Learn to
                        Study the Bible. Recently I also completed my Masters of Divinity at Southern Baptist
                        Theological Seminary. I joined the team at Cornerstone in 2020 and was blessed to become the
                        Lead Pastor on the church’s 30th anniversary in 2022.

            <h1>OUR BELIEFS</h1>
            <p>We recognize that there are some CORE issues of Christianity and some PERIPHERAL issues. An example of a
                CORE issue <br>
                would be the resurrection of Jesus. The only opinion taught is that there was a physical resurrection of
                Jesus. An example of a <br>
                PERIPHERAL issue would be how often you should take communion. It is an issue about which there is room
                for more than one <br>
                opinion. Whether to sing hymns or choruses is a PERIPHERAL issue while the fact that we only come to God
                through Jesus is a <br>
                CORE issue.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div>
                    <h4>IN CORE ISSUES – WE HAVE UNITY</h4>
                    <p>“There is one body and one spirit…there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and
                        Father of us all.” Ephesians 4:4</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>IN PERIPHERAL ISSUES – WE HAVE LIBERTY</h4>
                    <p>“Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters. Who are you to
                        judge someone else’s servant? To <br>
                        his own master he stands or falls…so then each of us will give an account of himself to God…so
                        whatever you believe about these <br>
                        things keep between yourself and God.” Romans 14:1, 4, 12, 22</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>IN ALL OUR BELIEFS – WE SHOW LOVE</h4>
                    <p>“If I hold in my mind not only all human knowledge but also the very secrets of God, and if I
                        have
                        the faith that can move mountains <br>
                        but have no love, I amount to nothing at all.” 1 Corinthians 13:2</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>A HEALTHY CHURCH…</h4>
                    <p>At Cornerstone we are confident enough in the truth of the gospel that we don’t get nervous if someone doesn’t believe even on a <br>
                         core issue. Although we will never allow alternative teaching on core issues, we do believe in giving people time to realize the truth.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS…</h4>
                    <p>People are made in the spiritual image of God, to be like him in character. People are the supreme object of God’s creation. <br>
                         Although every person has the tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called <br>
                          “sin”. This attitude separates people from God and causes many problems in life. Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6; <br>
                           Romans 3:23; Isaiah 59:1,2</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>ABOUT SALVATION…</h4>
                    <p>Salvation is God’s free gift to us but we must accept it. We can never make up for our sins by self-improvement or good works. Only <br>
                         by trusting in Jesus Christ as God’s offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin’s penalty. When we turn from our self-ruled <br>
                          life and turn to Jesus in faith we are saved. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith. <br>
                         Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8,9; John 14:6, 1:12; Titus 3:5; Galatians 3:26; Romans 5:1</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>ABOUT ETERNITY…</h4>
                    <p>People were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or eternally with God through <br>
                         forgiveness and salvation. John 3:16; John 14:17; Romans 6:23; Romans 8:17-18; Revelation 20:15; 1 Corinthians 2:7-9</p>
